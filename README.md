Learning python with minecraft - simple python notebooks

We will develop programs (games) using python which can interact with Minecraft for example our mars-mission game can be updated to interact with a minecraft server.

To implement this we need 3 things

Python development API we use jupyter notebook for testing and development. Python version 3 is recommended. We used ananconda version 2 but  set up a python 3 environment using the command activate my_py3 (this is a conda environment command). Jupyter hub was installed and started using the command jupyter notebook. This is started from an anaconda command prompt
Minecraft server. We have a java implemetation using a jar library called spigot it’s important this is updated in step with the current version of minecraft.. Java edition. Started from a windows command prompt
A working version of minecraft (Java edition)

The server and python development API can be downloaded from here

It’s important to make sure the spigot server for the minecraft server is upto date here is a useful repository
